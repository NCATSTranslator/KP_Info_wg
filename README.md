QUESTIONS GENERIC TO ALL KPs

What are all the EPC attributes you use?
Which SmartAPI endpoints are currently active?
Is there a finite list of IDs your KP use for the categories in the METAKG or does your KP use all IDs from a given external source?

If you use external sources, please respond for each external source:
   Do you use all or part of it?
   What are the reasons for you to use only this part/all?
   What was your intent when selecting this entire external source/part of the external source?
   What are the multihop queries you had in mind when selecting this external source?
   Do you curate or transform the data from the external source in any way? If so, how?
   
What other data/information/knowledge could you provide that you don't.
